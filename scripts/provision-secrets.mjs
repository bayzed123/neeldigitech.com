/**
 * Puts the Worker's secrets in place: a JWT signing key, and the Steadfast
 * courier credentials.
 *
 * JWT_SECRET is written through when the repository provides one; otherwise a
 * strong random value is generated on the first deploy and then left alone
 * forever after — rotating it on every run would sign every admin out each
 * deploy.
 *
 * The courier keys are only ever written when the repository supplies them.
 * Writing an empty string instead would be worse than leaving them unset: the
 * Worker would believe it was configured and every courier call would fail
 * against the portal, rather than the dashboard simply saying "not connected".
 *
 * Run after `wrangler deploy` (the script has to exist first). Worker secrets
 * take effect immediately, so no redeploy is needed. No secret value is ever
 * printed — only its name and what happened to it.
